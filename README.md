    <td>PaperBrock</td>
    <td>Students lacked a community and tools to efficiently prepare for exams.</td>
    <td>Experiencing this issue firsthand, I developed PaperBrock to address five core problems, creating features that enhance students' exam preparation phases.</td>
    <td><a href="https://github.com/parshvJS/paperbrock" target="_blank">PaperBrock Repository</a></td>
    <td><b>Exam Analyzer</b>: Provides a baseline for exam preparation by analyzing syllabi and past exam papers, offering deep insights and focus areas.</td>
    <td><b>Practice Papers</b>: Centralizes exam paper creation, allowing students to practice in a simulated exam environment.</td>
    <td><b>Exam Space</b>: Auto-configures an exam space for signed-in students, grouping them with peers sharing similar interests.</td>

    <td>We.</td>
    <td>No app integrated seamlessly with human lifestyles to manage general tasks (recently addressed by Apple).</td>
    <td>Identified three major areas: Task Scheduling & Automation, Chat Organization, and Document Management, creating features to address these.</td>
    <td><a href="https://github.com/parshvJS/we." target="_blank">We. Repository</a></td>
    <td><b>Task Management & Automation</b>: Users can join specific organizations (students to colleges, employees to companies) and leverage AI to optimize daily schedules, boosting productivity.</td>
    <td><b>Chat & Document Organization</b>: Automatically generates documentation based on users' task schedules, facilitating organized communication and document management.</td>

    <td>While we frequently clone recipes and projects, replicating desktop setups with configurations was challenging.</td>
    <td>Developed Desk Labs, allowing users to share and replicate complete desktop setups, including configurations.</td>
    <td><a href="https://github.com/parshvJS/Desk-Labs" target="_blank">Desk Labs Repository</a></td>
    <td><b>Social Media Integration</b>: Users can post, repost, like, and comment on setups.</td>
    <td><b>Config Space</b>: Creators can list all items used in their setups, enabling others to clone and repost the configurations.</td>
