<h2>Problems That Phases And Tried To Solve</h2>
1. PaperBrock
Problem: Students lacked a community and tools to efficiently prepare for exams.

Solution: Experiencing this issue firsthand, I developed PaperBrock to address five core problems, creating features that enhance students' exam preparation phases.

Repository: PaperBrock Repository

Features:

Exam Analyzer: Provides a baseline for exam preparation by analyzing syllabi and past exam papers, offering deep insights and focus areas.
Practice Papers: Centralizes exam paper creation, allowing students to practice in a simulated exam environment.
Exam Space: Auto-configures an exam space for signed-in students, grouping them with peers sharing similar interests.
2. We.
Problem: No app integrated seamlessly with human lifestyles to manage general tasks (recently addressed by Apple).

Solution: Identified three major areas: Task Scheduling & Automation, Chat Organization, and Document Management, creating features to address these.

Repository: We. Repository

Features:

Task Management & Automation: Users can join specific organizations (students to colleges, employees to companies) and leverage AI to optimize daily schedules, boosting productivity.
Chat & Document Organization: Automatically generates documentation based on users' task schedules, facilitating organized communication and document management.
3. Desk Labs
Problem: While we frequently clone recipes and projects, replicating desktop setups with configurations was challenging.

Solution: Developed Desk Labs, allowing users to share and replicate complete desktop setups, including configurations.

Repository: Desk Labs Repository

Features:

Social Media Integration: Users can post, repost, like, and comment on setups.
Config Space: Creators can list all items used in their setups, enabling others to clone and repost the configurations.
